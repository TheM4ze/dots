Xmenu is a menu utility for X.
Xmenu receives a menu specification in stdin, shows a menu for the user
to select one of the options, and outputs the option selected to stdout.

ยง Installation

In order to build xmenu you need the Xlib header files.

Edit config.mk to match your local setup (xmenu is installed into the
/usr/local prefix by default).  Then enter the following command to
build and install xmenu (if necessary as root).

	make clean install


ยง Running xmenu

xmenu receives as input a menu specification where each line is a menu
entry.  Each line can be indented with tabs to represent nested menus.
Each line is made out of a label and a command separated by any number
of tabs.  Lines without labels are menu separators.

See the script ./xmenu.sh for an example of how xmenu can be used to
draw a simple menu with submenus and separators.

Read the manual for more information on running xmenu.
